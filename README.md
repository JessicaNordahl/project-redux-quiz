# Redux quiz group project

This is a group-project with Madelene Trang, Amanda Tilly, Jessica Nordahl, Jessica Falk and Kara Howes.

The aim of this Group-project was to use Redux technology and the Global state to produce a multiple-choice Quiz.

## The problem

We approached the problem by mob-programming to lay the foundations of the project and we continued this approach through-out. From the beginning we determined our goals and worked together towards them. We used the useSelector and useDispatch hooks to fetch and dispatch information to the Global Store. We also implemented Switch to build a multi-page site.
If we had more time, we would like to conditionally render images on the Summary component and implement a visual progress bar.
We found this project challenging due to the specific syntax required for Redux, but together as a team we overcame the difficulties and completed the project.
